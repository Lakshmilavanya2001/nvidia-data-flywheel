# text is getting printed in cells and commands are getting printed in plain text

Got it üëç ‚Äî I see exactly what happened:

When converting your **DOCX ‚Üí Markdown**, the formatting was slightly off:

- **Headings and bullet points** came out fine.
- But **commands (bash, python, sql snippets)** got rendered as **plain text instead of code blocks**.
- Also, some parts like "*bash*" or "*python*" inside the text look like ordinary words in cells instead of rendered fenced blocks.

***

‚úÖ The fix:
We should explicitly wrap commands with fenced code blocks (```` ```````/ ``````python``````` ```````) instead of leaving the label "bash" or "sql" as plain text.

Here‚Äôs a **cleaner sample correction** from your file:

üö´ What you currently see:

```
bash

sudo docker run -d \\
--name hanaexpress \\
...
```

‚úÖ Correct Markdown formatting:

```
sudo docker run -d \
--name hanaexpress \
--restart unless-stopped \
--ulimit nofile=1048576:1048576 \
--sysctl kernel.shmmax=1073741824 \
--sysctl kernel.shmall=8388608 \
-p 39013:39013 -p 39015:39015 -p 39017:39017 \
-v /data/hana:/hana/mount \
--security-opt seccomp=unconfined \
saplabs/hanaexpress:latest \
--passwords-url file:///hana/mount/password.json
```

Similarly:

üö´ Current:

```
sql

SELECT TABLE_NAME, COLUMN_NAME, DATA_TYPE_NAME FROM SYS.TABLE_COLUMNS WHERE SCHEMA_NAME = 'YOUR_SCHEMA';
```

‚úÖ Correct:

```
SELECT TABLE_NAME, COLUMN_NAME, DATA_TYPE_NAME 
FROM SYS.TABLE_COLUMNS 
WHERE SCHEMA_NAME = 'YOUR_SCHEMA';
```


---

üëâ So the solution is:

- Wherever you see lines like `bash`, `python`, or `sql` at the start of a code section ‚Üí convert them into **fenced Markdown code blocks with syntax highlighting**.
- This way, commands are displayed properly and no longer look like plain text in cells.

---

‚ö° Question for you:
Do you want me to **(a)** regenerate the entire Markdown document with all code snippets properly formatted (bash/python/sql blocks), or just provide you with a **fixing script** (e.g., in Python) that can clean your existing Markdown automatically?
